### A brand new application that centralizes and simplifies real estate data.
Try it out [here](https://forrest-fan.github.io/community-watch/).

#### It's way too hard to find all the information about a certain neighbourhood. So we've done it for you.
We processed historical price and sales data in every Toronto neighbourhood and paired it with local police, transportation, and education data to help home-buyers get all the information they need. Built in one simple platform, this app aims to make researching homes enjoyable and relaxing by sheltering users from overwhelming data, saving time and effort on research, and providing a seamless user experience.
